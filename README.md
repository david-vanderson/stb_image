# stb_image

This is a temporary repo to enable dvui to use stb_image with zig 0.11.x.

Once zig's c import stuff is good enough to directly include this, or the package manager gains the ability to have a c file as part of a zig module, then this repo will be retired and stb_image.h will be directly included in dvui.
